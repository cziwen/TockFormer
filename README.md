## 🧠 Overview

**TockFormer** is an end-to-end pipeline for real-time quantitative financial signal generation. The system follows this modular workflow:

1. 🔌 **Real-time Tick Ingestion**  
   - Subscribe to live trade data via WebSocket  
   - Aggregate and write to a CSV(or any db you prefer)

2. 🧠 **Feature Engineering (FactorFactory)**  
   - Automatic factor generation and search

3. 🤖 **Model Inference**  
   - Feed curated features into machine learning models for prediction

4. 💡 **Signal Generation**  
   - Output trading signals based on model results (to be finalized)

## ⚡ Quick Start

> **Note:** The environment setup is still evolving. Commonly used libraries include:
> - `numpy`  
> - `pandas`  
> - `torch` *(install either the CPU or GPU version depending on your system)*
> - and many other packages...

### 🔧 Steps to Run:
1. Open `Utility/AggrData.py` and configure your **Finnhub API token**.  
   - A free token is available at [https://finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io)
2. Set your preferred **log file** and **CSV output paths** inside the script or via environment variables. 
   - run `benchmark_websocket.ipynb` to see what is your device's IO speed. normally a popular symbol has 3000 ticks/sec, so this file tells you how many symbol you can subscribe at one time.
3. Start the pipeline with:

```bash
python launcher.py \
      --script Utility/AggrData.py \
      --start "2025-05-04 03:00:00" \
      --end   "2025-05-04 21:00:00"
```
> ###### Why use --start and --end ? 
> Finnhub’s historical tick data endpoint only returns data up to the end of a trading day, and the final data for the day is typically only available after 8:00 PM US Eastern Time (during Daylight Saving Time).
> 
> ###### To ensure complete data retrieval, I recommend scheduling the launcher.py script to run at 3:00 AM Eastern Time the following day. This timing guarantees that all tick data for the previous trading day is fully accessible.

## 🖥️ Legacy Scripts

- `main_train.py` and `main_evaluate.py` were initially designed for Linux environments.  
- These scripts are **not required for normal usage** and are currently **not actively maintained**.
