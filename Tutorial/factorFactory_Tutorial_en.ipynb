    "## 3. Generating First-Order Factors (The `generate_factors` Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we call the `generate_factors` method of `FactorFactory` to compute first-order factors.\n",
    "First-order factors refer to technical indicators or features that are directly calculated from the base columns, such as RSI, moving averages, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **(1) Compute first-order factors**: Apply registered factor functions (such as RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD) to each original data column to obtain various technical indicator factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(2) Generate cross features**: Perform predefined arithmetic combinations (e.g., addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, sin/cos, etc.) on first-order factors, and apply factor functions again to create second-order and higher-order features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(3) Merge and clean**: Combine all generated factors into a feature matrix and remove columns with constant or missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(4) Factor evaluation**: Evaluate the retained factors by computing metrics such as Spearman rank correlation (IC), rolling IC information ratio (IR), and principal component coefficients.\n",
    "  The results are stored in a summary. Based on our setting `top_k=10`, only the top 10 highest-scoring factors will be kept, and the rest will be discarded.\n",
    "  During evaluation, a positive return over the next 5 days is treated as a positive class, while a negative return is treated as a negative class—effectively framing it as a binary classification of 5-day price movements.\n",

    "From the results, we can observe that the clustering quality varies depending on the algorithm and the number of clusters.\n",

    "Similarly, ***GaussianMixture*** also performs comparably well with 2 clusters.\n",
